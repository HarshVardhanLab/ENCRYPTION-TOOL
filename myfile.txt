Rest the sore muscles — avoid training the same muscles for 1–2 days.
Apply a cold compress or ice pack for 10–15 minutes to reduce inflammation.
Do light stretching — improves blood flow and eases stiffness.
Stay hydrated — drink plenty of water throughout the day.
Take warm showers — helps relax tight muscles.
Eat protein-rich foods (like eggs, paneer, chicken, dal, or whey protein) to repair muscles.
Get proper sleep — recovery happens when you rest.
⚠️ Avoid:
Heavy lifting on sore muscles.
Skipping warm-up or cool-down next time.
If the soreness lasts more than 4–5 days, or if you have sharp pain (not just muscle ache), then it’s better to rest and maybe consult a trainer or doctor.
